[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kanongil/node-hls-segment-reader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kanongil/node-hls-segment-reader)

## API

### new HlsSegmentReader(uri, [options])

Creates an `objectMode` `Readable`, which returns segments from the `uri`, as specified in `options`.

#### Options

 * `fullStream` - Always start from first segment. Otherwise, follow standard client behavior.
 * `withData` - Set to open & return data streams for each segment.
 * `startDate` - Select initial segment based on datetime information in the index.
 * `stopDate` - Stop stream after this date based on datetime information in the index.
 * `maxStallTime` - Stop live/event stream if index has not been updated in `maxStallTime` ms.
 * `extensions` - Allow specified index extensions, as specified in `m3u8parse`.

### Event: `index`

 * `index` - `M3U8Playlist` with parsed index.

Emitted whenever a new remote index has been parsed.

### Event: `data`

 * `obj` - `HlsSegmentObject` containing segment data.

### HlsSegmentReader#abort([graceful])

Stop the reader.

### HlsSegmentObject

 * `type` - `'segment'` or `'init'`.
 * `file` - File metadata from remote server.
 * `stream` - `uristream` `Readable` with segment data when `withData` is set.
 * `segment` - Object with segment data, when type is `'segment'`:
   * `seq` - Sequence number.
   * `details` - `M3U8Segment` info.
 * `init` - m3u8 `AttrList` with map segment data when type is `'init'`.
